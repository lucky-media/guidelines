At [Lucky Media](https://www.luckymedia.dev) we have created a starter kit in the Figma design application that includes various reusable components, default color palettes, typography styles, shadow styles, a layout grid, and many more.

One of the main advantages of using a starter kit is that it saves time and effort in creating design elements from scratch.
LuckyMedia's starter kit includes:
- Buttons,
- Checkboxes,
- Dropdowns,
- Icons,
- Input Fields,
- Pills/Badges,
- Radio Buttons,
and many more.

These components can be easily customized to fit the needs of any project, by being consistent you make sure that if you need a change, that can be achieved only by tweaking one frame.

The default color palettes provided on LuckyMedia's starter kit are imported from TailwindCSS, a popular CSS framework we use all the time. Using these predefined color palettes helps designers create a cohesive color scheme, however that can be easily tweaked if needed. The typography styles and shadow styles provided on the starter kit also help designers maintain a functional look and feel.

LuckyMedia's starter kit also includes a layout grid that serves as a guide for designing and dividing sections. The grid helps designers ensure that their designs are aligned and balanced, making the design process faster and more efficient.

LuckyMedia's starter kit provides a comprehensive set of tools for designers and developers to create web applications efficiently and effectively. By using the components, color palettes, typography styles, shadow styles, layout grid, and 404 page provided by the starter kit, designers can save time and effort in creating design elements from scratch, and developers can ensure that the design is consistent and cohesive throughout the application. With a predefined set of components, designers can easily communicate their design intent to developers, who can then implement the design quickly and efficiently. This can help reduce misunderstandings and errors during the development process, saving time and effort.

Companies use wireframes to create a skeletal framework of the website or application they are building. Wireframes are typically created before any visual design elements are added, as they provide a way to map out the structure and functionality of a website or app without getting bogged down in details. Wireframes typically consist of simple, low-fidelity visual elements such as boxes, lines, and text. Once the wireframe is created, it can be shared with clients to give them a clear sense of how the website or app will be organized and how it will function. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page before moving on to more detailed design elements.
