The guideline includes information on work steps used by Lucky Media on creating a new project, provided in details which contains various elements that can make the design more efficiently and consistent.

This work process is defined into 4 stages:
1. Meeting with the client
2. Product, it's purpose and Research
3. Design
4. Development and Testing

### Meeting with the client
The management and design team arrange a one-on-one meeting with their client to discuss and understand the client's requirements. During this meeting, they take notes and define a moodboard to ensure clarity. We firmly believe that conducting such individual meetings enhances the relationship between our company and the client. As the meeting progresses, the designers gain a better understanding of the client's expectations, enabling them to address any technical queries or concerns directly.

The design team assumes responsibility for determining the website's sections and establishing the workflow. They consolidate information gathered from various sources such as emails, documents, and client requirements to form a comprehensive summary.

### Product, it's purpose and Research
Following our insightful client meeting, our dedicated UI/UX team embarked on a journey to define the value and purpose of the product/website they are about to make. We carefully analyzed the client's requirements, considered their target audience, and defined the core objectives they aim to achieve.

With a deep understanding of the client's vision, we set out to craft a user-centric experience that not only fulfills their needs but also exceeds their expectations. We conducted extensive research to identify user pain points, preferences, and behaviors, enabling us to create a seamless and intuitive interface.

Our team diligently brainstormed and ideated innovative design concepts that align with the product/website's objectives. We sought to strike a harmonious balance between aesthetics and functionality, ensuring a visually captivating and user-friendly experience.

By focusing on the value proposition and purpose of the product/website, our UI/UX team is determined to deliver a compelling solution that not only meets the client's objectives but also resonates with their target audience, ultimately driving success and achieving the desired impact.

### Design
Upon obtaining the client's approval for the technical aspects and work process, we kindly request them to provide us with content related to their company, including logos, descriptions, images, color styles, and other relevant materials.

Our UI/UX team follows a systematic approach consisting of four key phases:
1. Wireframing
2. Initial Design
3. Feedback and Adaption
4. Isnification

1. Wireframing

To begin, we duplicate our Figma Starter Project and make adjustments to our foundational components. We meticulously consider the related components that are crucial for effective wireframing. This typically involves refining margins, paddings, radiuses, fonts, and other relevant components necessary for wireframing. Once these adjustments are complete, we proceed with creating the wireframe for the project. 

During the wireframing phase, we initially establish a basic structure of the website and it's flow. This serves as a foundation that we can share with the client to ensure alignment and verify that we are in sync with their expectations. We ensure seamless communication with the client by sharing a Figma link that presents the basic concept of the website. We eagerly await their valuable feedback to incorporate their input and align our design with their expectations.

2. Initial Design

Moving on to the Initial Design phase, we transform the wireframe into a polished and visually appealing design. This stage involves adapting the wireframe elements into tangible design components. Colors are defined, components receive detailed attention regarding attributes like color, radius, widths, and typography. The design process may vary based on client preferences and the nature of the product.

Throughout this phase, we engage in a collaborative process, continually refining the components. We iterate on the design, making tweaks and adjustments until we achieve an optimal solution for each object or section. The client remains involved in the process, by being a part of the Figma Project where they can leave comments and suggest changes whenever necessary.

3. Feedback and Adaption

In the Feedback and Adaptation phase, we focus on incorporating client-provided content such as images and other relevant materials. We also adapt and refactor the website based on the client's approvals and feedback received during the Initial Design and this phase. This ensures that the final design aligns seamlessly with their requirements and preferences.

4. Isnification

Isnification is the word we use when the design team gets the design ready for development.
After getting the final approval from the client on the desktop version, we proceed to adapt the website for mobile screens. 
Throughout this process we start by refactoring our components, states and present all the repeatable objects on a page that can be defined from the beggining on the development process. 

We export pictures, we prepare the SVG logos, export the list of the icons used by their name, provide the link for the fonts used and we make sure that the font provided have the following WOFF,WOFF2 formats (to ensure compatibility across different devices), provide the colors in HEX formats with their tints and shades in a JSON format. 
We ensure the design is responsive and optimally presented on various devices in order to provide top tier quality. 

The idea for the word Isnification came from Art (Yes, that's his name), our first designer ( Yes, our designer is named Art ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ), who was working with a developer called Isni. Nowadays we have a much bigger team of developers and designers, but Isnification is still used regularly. And yes, Isni is still with us, as well as the designer, Art.

### Development and Testing
Following the design phase, the Design Team initiates a meeting with the Development Team to share the project details, explain the structure, and provide necessary assets and configuration files. This collaborative session ensures seamless coordination and enables the Development Team to select the most suitable technology stack for programming the product. The Design Team remains readily available throughout the development process, addressing inquiries and assisting with use cases that may arise.

Once all the aforementioned processes are completed, the website progresses to the staging phase. At this stage, the Design Team employs a comprehensive checklist to verify the successful completion of tasks. Issues are created on the corresponding GitHub repository to track and ensure task completion. If all tasks are successfully accomplished, the website undergoes internal testing by the team to evaluate its functionality. Following the internal testing phase, the product is delivered to the client for their review, ensuring its proper behavior and adherence to requirements.
