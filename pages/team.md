# Company Philosophy: Equality and Teamwork
In our company, we are all equal. We only differ by responsibilities and salaries.
The more we develop our professional skills, the more we get responsibilities, the higher the salary.

We try to build a friendly atmosphere where everyone is important and every idea counts. Although we have general 
team rules that we try to hold on to, we are always open to changing them if the need arises. Better yet, we even break 
those rules if a certain team member has a special case. Yep, that's right. We are all a team, but we also have 
different personalities and needs.

We can split our team into two major groups, part-time and full-time employees. 
We will explain their differences down the road.

## Teamwork: A Powerful Asset
That's probably our most beloved and powerful company asset. We expect all members to help each other for 
solving issues, brainstorming ideas or sharing knowledge. The time spent for teamwork is counted as 
effective work (explained below) and we strongly encourage it. This has greatly benefited the professional 
development of our team and it boosts our daily morale.

A more experienced developer helps a younger motivated teammate to learn all the required techniques that 
we use daily. The junior quickly learns more and more, until he gets to help his previous teacher 
for solving issues he knows about. Solving a certain issue doesn't immediately mean that the student 
has already overtaken the teacher. It simply shows that we can learn from everyone and we should be 
humble.

Our experience has proven to us that help can be misused sometimes. We encourage our members 
not to exceed 30 min/day of helping a fellow colleague. That's because they get spoiled, lazy and start 
asking questions for solutions that can be found on the first Google Search result. So, we usually help 
each other by recommending how specific issues can be solved. But, if the issue looks more 
complicated, we start coding together to find the best ways to solve the issue, always within the time limit.

## Communication
Our main communication tool is Discord. We have a channel where we organize all our daily activities.
The #general channel includes our main company notifications and discussions. The #fun channel is 
most used, we share funny gifs, jokes and have fun. We have other important channels too, but we also 
make a specific channel for each project and we gather only the members that will work on that project. 
This helps us stay organized without distracting members with information they don't need. We have 
integrated our Github organization account to show every activity.

Sometimes we create channels for our clients and we keep them informed about the project. It's very useful 
for both parties because the communication is much faster and we build a lasting relationship.

> We even have our own bot with many custom commands. It's our favorite Discord friend.

## Working Hours and Effective Work
We have flexible working hours, where each employee can decide when to start working according to their needs 
and daily routine.

### Effective Work
No, it's not the total hours we do programming. There is a lot of work throughout the day that isn't 
programming but it still counts as work. It includes the time we invest for:
- Brainstorming and discussing the best tech stack
- Researching the best solutions for present issues
- Reading/watching a tutorial for a new feature/technology
- Setting up the environment for development
- Teamwork and helping each other
- Designers talk to clients to better understand their needs and desires
- Testing before merging a Pull Request
- Documenting the code to simplify future changes and updates
- Monthly team meetings and quarterly individual progress meetings

We don't expect someone to pause the effective hours for every single activity. It's very normal to do 
some everyday activities such as using the kitchen for drinks 🍹, answering a phone call 📞, 
responding to messages 💬, telling/hearing a joke 😆, etc.

> A good rule of thumb is that about 5 minutes/activity is totally fine 👍

### Time Tracking
Wait a sec, time tracking? Really? No, this is not standard managerial control. It's a wonderful
tool for allowing employees to better organize their working hours.

Let's take a few examples for part-time employees:
- If they work more on a given day, they go earlier the next day.
- Worked 2 extra hours yesterday, took a break today, and will add 2 extra hours tomorrow.
- They can even take a day off and compensate during the weekend.

They decide their time management and we expect to see 20 effective hours a week.

As for full-time employees, it's impossible to do combinations during the day because we know how hard 
it is to be concetrated and do brain-intensive tasks for long hours. However, they can also:
- Take a day off and compensate during the weekend.
- Or work a few hours less and compensate during the weekend.

They decide their time management and we expect to see 35 effective hours a week.

A day at work is organized as follows:
- Full-time
  - 6 hours of coding
  - 1 hour of reviews and teamwork
- Part-time
  - 3.5 hours of coding
  - 30 minutes of reviews and teamwork

## Company Culture
We believe that we must always perform at the highest level, no matter if the client 
understands the quality we provide or not. That's what we try to instill into our team members as well.

Our project deadlines are always longer and flexible so we have enough time to produce quality work 
without stressing ourselves or our team members. We encourage our employees to take their time, 
have a deep breath, think about the solution, plan their steps and start working at their own pace. 
Every employee has its strength or weaknesses, and that's very normal for all human beings.

We tell many jokes and have lots of fun. But, we always try not to hurt other members' feelings. If a team 
member has a problem with another member, we encourage them to either let it go or let us know about it. 
We've seen that it's best if we mediate and try to help solve the misunderstandings. So far, there hasn't 
been a single major problem between any of us and we hope it's always this way.
