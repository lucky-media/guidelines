# Team
In our company, we are all equal. We only differ by responsibilities and salaries.
The more we develop our professional skills, the more responsibilities we take, the higher the salary.

We try to build a friendly atmosphere where everyone is important and every idea counts. Although we have general 
team rules that we try to hold on to, we are always open to change them if the need arises. Better yet, we even break 
those rules if a certain team member has a special case. Yep, that's right. We are all a team, but we also have 
different personalities and needs.

We can split our team in two major groups, part-time and full-time employees. 
We will explain their differences down the road.

## Teamwork
That's probably our most beloved and powerful company asset.  
We expect all members to help each other for problem solving, brainstorming ideas or sharing knowledge. The 
time spent for teamwork is counted as effective work (explained below) and we strongly encourage it. This has 
greatly benefited the professional development of our team and it boosts our daily morale.

A more experienced developer helps a younger motivated teammate to learn all the required techniques that 
we use on a daily basis. The junior quickly learns more and more, until he gets to help his previous teacher 
for solving issues he has knowledge about. Solving a certain issue doesn't immediately mean that the student 
has already overtaken the teacher. It simply shows that we can learn from everyone and we should be 
humble.

## Working Hours
We have flexible working hours, where each employee can decide when to start working according to their needs 
and daily routine. Our employees begin their work between:
- 8 am and 10 am (full-time)
- 10 am and 1 pm (part-time)

### Effective Work
No, it's not the total hours we do actual programming. There is a lot of work throughout the day that isn't 
programming but it is still work. It includes the time we invest for:
- Brainstorming and discussing about the best tech stack
- Researching the best solutions for present issues
- Reading/watching a tutorial for a new feature/technology
- Setting up the environment for development
- Teamwork and helping each other
- Designers talk to clients to better understand their needs and desires
- Testing before merging a Pull Request
- Documenting the code to simplify future changes and updates
- Monthly team meetings and quarterly individual progress meetings

We don't expect someone to pause the effective hours for every single activity. It's very normal to do 
some everyday activities such as using the kitchen for drinks 🍹, answering a phone call 📞, 
responding to messages 💬, telling/hearing a joke 😆, etc.

> A good rule of thumb is that 5 minutes/activity is totally fine 👍

### Time Tracking
Wait a sec, time tracking? Really? No, this is not standard managerial control. It's a wonderful
tool for allowing employees to better organize their working hours.

Let's take a few examples for the part-time employees:
- If they work more on a given day, they go earlier the next day.
- Worked 2 extra hours yesterday, took a break today, will add 2 extra hours tomorrow.
- They can even take a day off and compensate during the weekend.

They decide their time management and we expect to see 20 effective hours a week.

As for the full-time employees, it's impossible to do combinations during the day because we know how hard 
it is to be concetrated and do brain intensive tasks for long hours. However, they can also:
- Take a day off and compensate during the weekend.
- Or work a few hours less and compensate during the weekend.

They decide their time management and we expect to see 30 effective hours a week.

## Company Culture
We have always believed that it's our duty to always perform at the highest level, no matter if the client 
understands the quality we provide or not. That's what we try to instill into our team members as well.

Our project deadlines are always longer and flexible so we have enough time to produce qualitative work 
without stressing ourself or our team members. We encourage our employees to take their time, 
have a deep breath, think about the solution, plan their steps and start working at their own pace. 
Every employee has it's strength or weaknesses, and that's very normal for all human beings.

We tell many jokes and have lots of fun. But, we always try not to hurt other members' feelings. If a team 
member has a problem with another member, we encourage them to either let it go or let us know about it. 
We've seen that it's best if we mediate and try to help solve the misunderstandings. So far, there hasn't 
been a single major problem between any of us and we hope it's always this way.
