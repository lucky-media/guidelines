# Working with Pull Requests

Assuming we have an `Orders` ticket where we need to implement a feature that will take care of the orders, it's not a good idea to put this feature in one pull request (PR).

Solution: Split it into smaller PRs.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Review

Take a careful look at what the ticket is asking for. Identify the main functionality that needs to be implemented. This will help you identify what tasks need to be broken down.

### Break it down

Try to break the ticket into smaller tasks that can be handled individually. Think about the different stages of the order process, such as order placement, order confirmation, and order tracking. Each of these stages can be broken down further into smaller tasks.

### Prioritize

Once you have your list of smaller tasks, prioritize them based on what is most important or urgent. Consider dependencies, such as completing one task before another can be started, and any potential blockers that could prevent you from finishing a task.

### Assign ownership

Assign a specific person or team to each smaller task. This way, everyone knows what they are responsible for and can work independently without stepping on each other's toes.

### Work on the tasks

Start working through the tasks in the order you prioritized them. Encourage collaboration and communication between teams, so everyone stays up-to-date with what's happening.

### Test and iterate

Before marking a task as "done," make sure you test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Iterate on the task and make any necessary changes until it works perfectly.

### Move on to the next task

Once a task is complete, move on to the next task, repeating the same steps until all of the smaller tasks have been completed.

### Conclusion

By breaking down your Orders ticket into smaller, more manageable tasks, you'll be able to tackle it with ease. Just remember to prioritize, communicate, and iterate until you've completed every task.
