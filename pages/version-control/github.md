# Github

All our projects are hosted in Github, so the first thing to do here is to open a new Github Account if you haven't already.

### Using Github

We have an equal split of team members who use the command line and some who prefer Github Desktop.

- For CLI there is no extra step, just make sure you are authenticated with Github using a PA token.
- Here you can [download](https://desktop.github.com/) Github Desktop.
