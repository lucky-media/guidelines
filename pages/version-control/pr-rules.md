# Pull Request Rules

Here are 5 rules for effective and manageable pull requests:

### Keep pull requests focused

Try to isolate changes within a pull request to a small, well-defined set of features or fixes. This makes the code easier to review and reduces the risk of merge conflicts. Also, avoid formatting changes, unrelated code changes and debug code in pull requests. Your PR ideally should not contain more than five (5) changed files.

### Write clear and concise descriptions

Clearly describe the changes made, why they were made, and how they were tested. This helps reviewers understand the purpose of the changes and makes their job easier. It's also useful to provide screenshots or links to related issues or documents.

### Test changes thoroughly

Before submitting a pull request, make sure that the code works as intended and passes relevant tests. The more thoroughly you test your code, the easier it will be for reviewers to verify that your changes are correct.

### Respond to feedback promptly

Be responsive to feedback from reviewers and make any requested changes as quickly as possible. This helps keep the review process moving forward and minimizes frustration for everyone involved.

### Collaborate with reviewers

Treat the review process as a collaboration, not a personal critique. Listen to feedback and be open to suggestions, even if you don't always agree with them. Remember that everyone wants to produce the best possible code, and working together is the best way to achieve that goal.
